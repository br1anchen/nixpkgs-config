# Standing orders

Numbered lines, one constraint each. The master pastes the path of this file
into every brief. Append a line the moment you catch yourself repeating an
instruction (the encode-lessons-in-structure principle).

1. Sidekick writes only inside the brief's SCOPE. Anything else is a follow-up in the report.
2. Every claim in a report carries its command output or file pointer in the same section.
3. No push, no PR, no force-push, no rebase of shared branches unless the brief says so.
4. On timebox expiry, stop, write a partial report, end the turn.
5. A question for the human goes in the report under Questions with status `blocked`; the master owns the human.
6. Approval dialogs: the master reads them and asks the human. Neither agent answers the other's dialogs.
7. Devin defaults to bypass permissions; other kinds inherit the master's permission mode. Explicit permission overrides take precedence. Neither agent changes its own mode.
8. Sidekick progress log: one line per completed todolist step and per change of approach, via `kitchen.sh progress`. A STEER is read the moment it arrives, between tool calls, and agreed or objected to there; two fresh steers per brief, two rounds each.
9. Consultant never writes a non-ignored path in the shared tree and never builds, tests, or installs there. Prototypes and builds run in `kitchen.sh scratch`, removed before the advice is sent.
10. Consultant advice is advisory: the master decides and records an overrule in the review. Three consults per unit; a fourth is a plan round.
11. Sidekick and consultant never message each other. Both read the store; only the master writes plans, briefs, steers, consults, reviews.
12. Sidekick records every step with `kitchen.sh step`; a step whose gates fail is fixed in a new commit, never skipped or recorded by hand.
13. A repo policy rule is opted out of only on the line, with `kitchen-allow: <id>` and the reason beside it; the review reads every such line.
14. The verifier writes only its verdict file and the scratch worktree it was given, and never edits the code it verifies.
15. Landing never merges; it goes as far as `[landing].mode` in the repo's kitchen.toml, and only after `kitchen.sh land-check` passes.
