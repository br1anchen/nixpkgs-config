# Standing orders

Numbered lines, one constraint each. The master pastes the path of this file
into every brief. Append a line the moment you catch yourself repeating an
instruction (the encode-lessons-in-structure principle).

1. Sidekick writes only inside the brief's SCOPE. Anything else is a follow-up in the report.
2. Every claim in a report carries its command output or file pointer in the same section.
3. No push, no PR, no force-push, no rebase of shared branches unless the brief says so.
4. On timebox expiry, stop, write a partial report, end the turn.
5. A question for the human goes in the report under Questions with status `blocked`; the master owns the human.
6. Approval dialogs: the master reads them and asks the human. Neither agent answers the other's dialogs.
7. All three agents run in the master's permission mode, auto unless the human said otherwise. Neither agent changes its own mode.
8. Sidekick progress log: one line per completed todolist step and per change of approach, via `pair.sh progress`. A STEER is read the moment it arrives, between tool calls, and agreed or objected to there; two fresh steers per brief, two rounds each.
9. Consultant never writes a non-ignored path in the shared tree and never builds, tests, or installs there. Prototypes and builds run in `pair.sh scratch`, removed before the advice is sent.
10. Consultant advice is advisory: the master decides and records an overrule in the review. Three consults per unit; a fourth is a plan round.
11. Sidekick and consultant never message each other. Both read the store; only the master writes plans, briefs, steers, consults, reviews.
